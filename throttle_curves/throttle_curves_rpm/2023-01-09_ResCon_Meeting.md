# Meeting with ResCon guys

Focus on display, displaying the data. Doesn't have to be live, can take data from engine and put it in a ROS bag and then animate it.

Thrust stepping to model the engine, how will load on generator change the thrust? 

~60-80 kW of thrust
~1kW of electrical power
So this shouldn't effect the thrust really. Could run ducted fan to burn as much energy as possible

- Calibrate load cell
- Buy new fuel tanks
- Put github on OUIDEAS
- Nick is pressing ahead on modeling the engine
- Sending Nick all of the data from the engine

- There is a lot of data that is needed next week, but it's only our part of the system, not the entire electronics thing.
